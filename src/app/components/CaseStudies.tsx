    summary:
      "In this case study, I led a research initiative to identify pain points and opportunities for improving user retention in a fitness app. I implemented habit-forming features such as personalized workout reminders, progress tracking, and community-driven challenges. These features were designed to keep users engaged by reinforcing positive behaviors and encouraging consistency. The strategy led to a 30% improvement in user retention, showcasing the impact of tailored, user-centered design on long-term engagement.",
